Leaving your mother

“Send me a texts so I know how you’re doing!”
“Are you sure that jacket is warm enough?”
“Take lots of pictures!”



Healing you

“Did some kid at school do this to you?”
“A kissy kiss from mama will make that boo boo all better!”
“When are you going to get a wife?”




Killing monsters

“Get off my property!”
“No solicitors! Can’t you read?!”
